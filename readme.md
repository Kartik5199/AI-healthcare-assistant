## 🚀 **Features**  
✅ **Disease Prediction:** Predicts **diabetes, heart disease, and brain tumors** using trained ML models.  
✅ **Medicine Lookup:** Search **medicines by name or disease**, with **autocomplete** for real-time suggestions.  
✅ **Brain Tumor Detection:** Uses **CNN-based deep learning model** for detecting tumors from MRI scans.  
✅ **Dark Mode UI:** Built with **Tailwind CSS**, supports **light & dark themes** dynamically.  
✅ **Secure Backend:** Flask API with **MongoDB** integration for optimized searches.

## 🛠️ **Tech Stack**  
🔹 **Backend:** Flask, Python, MongoDB, TensorFlow, OpenCV  
🔹 **Frontend:** HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript  
🔹 **ML Models:** Scikit-Learn (disease prediction), CNN (brain tumor detection)  



## 🔧 **Installation & Setup**  
Clone the repository:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kartik5199/AI-healthcare-assistant.git
cd AI-healthcare-assistant
```

Install dependencies:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the Flask app:  
```bash
python app.py
```

## 💡 **How It Works**  
### **1️⃣ Disease Prediction**  
- User inputs health metrics → ML model predicts **diabetes/heart disease** probability.  
- Brain tumor detection processes **MRI images** through a **CNN model** and returns a diagnosis.  

### **2️⃣ Medicine Lookup**  
- **Search by Medicine Name:** Retrieves medicine details (composition, uses, side effects).  
- **Search by Disease Name:** Suggests relevant medicines **(with autocomplete feature)**.

## 🚀 **Future Enhancements**  
🔹 Deploy on **AWS/GCP** for better scalability.  
🔹 Improve **autocomplete search** using **Elasticsearch**.  
🔹 Enhance UI with **React.js** for a better experience.
